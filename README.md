# real-estate-website-react
The Real Estate Website is a modern, responsive web application designed to showcase real estate properties through a clean and user-friendly interface. This project simulates a real-world property listing platform and focuses on practical web development skills.

Users can browse property listings, view detailed information, and contact through a working email feature, making the project closer to a real production-level application. This project reflects my learning journey in frontend development with an emphasis on clean UI, component-based architecture, and real-world functionality.
